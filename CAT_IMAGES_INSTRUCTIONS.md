# Cat Images Setup Instructions

Please save the two cat images you provided to the following locations:

1. **Cat with closed mouth** (first image):
   - Save as: `assets/images/cat-closed-mouth.png`
   - This should be flipped horizontally to face right

2. **Cat with open mouth** (second image):
   - Save as: `assets/images/cat-open-mouth.png`
   - This should be flipped horizontally to face right

## How to flip the images:
- You can use any image editor to flip the images horizontally
- Or the app will handle the flipping automatically with `transform: [{ scaleX: -1 }]`

## What the cat system does:
1. **Cat Header**: Shows at the top of the Feed screen
2. **Eating Animation**: When users bite posts, the cat opens its mouth and "eats"
3. **Growth**: Cat gets bigger as it eats more bites
4. **Chewing Motion**: 3 quick chew cycles when eating
5. **Future Features**: Bite extraction animation, image restoration, advanced interactions

Once you save these images, the cat feature will be fully functional!
